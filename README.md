# wp-background-processing-example

This repo contains an example plugin, which demonstrates how to use [WP Background Processing](https://github.com/A5hleyRich/wp-background-processing).

I’ve put together a very simple example plugin, which demonstrates how background processing works. The plugin logs random names followed by Lorem Ipsum, which is generated by making a call to the loripsum.net API. To imitate a long running process it sleeps for 5 seconds before processing the queue item.

Task:
Clicking the ‘All Users’ link will push 20 random names to the queue and begin processing immediately.
